# Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis for sample super store.

## EDA with Python Scikit Learn

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start doing EDA for retail shop sales.

## EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
